# @conterra/reactivity-decorators

> Decorators for simplified creation of reactive classes.

> NOTE: Decorators provided by this package are based on the [Decorators proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators), which is currently in stage 3.
> As there are no browsers that implement this proposal (yet), you need to configure a transpiler.
>
> Transpilers with support for decorators include:
>
> -   TypeScript
> -   esbuild
> -   swc
> -   Babel
